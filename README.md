# Description
This library is used to control user access on the HMI. Many applications require different levels of access for different users. For example, an operator would only have access to what is required for production, and a developer could access jogging motors, tuning parameters, data logs, etc.

# Use Cases
Below are examples of personnel that could require different levels of access.

-Operator  
-Maintenance  
-Development  
-Management
